# RTEUÂ CE205 Data Structures Homework 4 by Utku Oruc

Hello Professor, this is my forth homework in Data Structures

- I implemented Lineer Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing and Seperate Chaining algorithms with MSAGL
- Every algorithm visualized with MSAGL, can be used with C# form, there are insert, delete and search buttons
- Double hashing's second algorithm is = 7 - data % 7.
- Put a big effort on this project

Have a nice day!
